# Convert a sentence which has either or to only the first choice.
# e.g we could either go to a movie or a hotel -> we could go to a movie.
# note: do not use intermediate lists (string.split), only use string functions
# assume words are separated by a single space. you can use control flow statements
# So sentence is of form <blah> either <something> or <somethingelse> and gets converted to <blah> <something>
# if it is not of the correct form, you just return the original sentence.
